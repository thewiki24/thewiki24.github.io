So excited!!! First day of training at Wavesmiley Industries, unfortunately our group is going to listen to those tapes now. BOOOORING. When do I get to make people SMILE and shit!!!

09:27
WOW ok some pretty juicy stuff in those tapes. Can't disclose what was in them or I "get sent to a correctional facility" but I think I know what to do now. We were given paintball guns and pepper spray in case we get assaulted by very unhappy people, but yeah I think I know what to do now. Very Easy Job.
